    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In string computation, the **exact pattern matching problem** is the problem of finding all the occurences of a pattern (string) P, in a text (string) S, where usually P is much shorter than S.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the pattern could be the world “stella” and the text the whole Divina Commedia, or P can be the CCATTGTG motif and the text the human genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to speed up the computation is to create an **index** on the pattern P and use this index to scan the text S in a more efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm** uses this approach. It first of all builds an index on P and then uses it to scan S, applying simple rules to the index to decide how to shift the pattern."

    "### A naive approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **naive algorithm** for pattern matching is to look for a word match at each index of S. So, at each position of S the algorithm check if there is a match with the first character of P. If there is, then the algorithm tests the other characters in P by comparing them to successive characters of S. If all successive characters match there is an occurence found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case in the use of the naive approach is if the two strings match in all but the last letter, for example S is a string of length n full of \"A\" and P is a string of length k full of \"A\", but the last character is different. In this case the algorithm compares k characters at each position in string S, so the time complexity is *O(kn)*"

    "## KMP algorithm\n",
    "The KMP algorithm, before scan S, creates an **index of P** which allows to use of **previous match information** in order to skip matches. In the example discussed above, where S is \"AAAAAA...A\" and P is \"AAA...AB\", when KMP sees a trial match fail on the last character of P, in the next iteration it will know that the first k-2 characters at the new position already match so it skip all of these comparisons."

    "### Index building\n",
    "The purpose of index building is to **find prefixes** of P that are also present in other positions of P.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this the algorithm scans P and for each position pos check if the suffix \\[pos:k\\] contains a prefix which is also a prefix for P. This **information** is then used in the KMP algorithm because it say the next position in S where we can start to match P and the number of matches that the algorithm can skip, because they are already checked in the previous iteration."

So the inner loop can execute at most as many times in total, as the outer loop has executed – each decrease of cnd by 1 in the inner loop needs to have a corresponding increase by 1 in the outer loop. Since the outer loop takes k-1 iterations, the inner loop can take no more than k-1 iterations in total.\n",
